    I'm Sabih (suh-bee). I have many ideas inspired from my daily observations. What excites me is building useful software that creates impact. I also enjoy programming and learning about the latest tools, including LLMs. If you want to learn more about me, check out my <a target="_blank" href="https://dub.sh/about-me">5 minute article.</a>

  <h2>What I'm up to now</h2>
    <div align="left">
      <p>Last updated Apr 1, 2025:</p>
      <p>Starting mid march, I've been looking for my next project. This is either an interesting startup idea I can join with my pre-existing team of 3 other developers. Or a job, ideally as a product engineer. The tech market is in shambles though ;-;. I live with my parents and have no bills so my risk appetite is high.</p> 
      <p>Before that, I was helping out with development of a pre-MVP startup for a month, for a contractor service businesses SaaS. The founder's dad owns a irrigation/lawn care company with 20-50 employees, less so during the winter as it's a seasonal business. He worked there for 4 years as the director of operations, and wanted to build a home service business software. He was 75% done with the MVP with one brazillian dev + another dev the latter brought on. But I left because the idea was unvalidated, he the founder only talked to 3 business owners in a meeting. And was making a classic mistake of building before validating. He has his dad's company lined up for teh pilot, but his dad isn't even the ideal customer as he said. Need to validate before writing a single line of done.</p>
      <p>Before that in, in mid feb, I put my current <a href="hellokeepsake.com"> legaltech startup</a> on life support. 8 months back in early July, I joined a pre-MVP SaaS startup for inheritance lawyers, as the technical cofounder. I brought it back to life by bringing in 3 of my friends part-time, with me leading them full-time, and managed to build out the entire lawyer side together. I made the decision to launch the beta on Nov 1, and since then, we are in beta with 4 lawyers. But growth is too slow, despite 600 hours of combined cold calling between 3 people, and countless emails. I hope my beta lawyers will spread the word and drive our growth. The founder of DecisionVault, our competitor, said in jan 2024 that most of his growth is from referrals. So I will let the product cruise and grow organically, while I focus my efforts on a new idea.</p>

  <h2 style="font-weight: bold">4 notable projects I made for fun/learning:</h2>
  <ul align="left">
    <li><span>Launched July 2024: </span><a href="https://antride.ca" target="_blank">antride.ca</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/ant-ride">code</a>: The easiest way to organize carpools for one-off events. Or even just find the location optimized carpool routes for a group of people. In beta and currently trying to get religious organizations and extracurricular clubs to use it. Just like how when2meet (or the better version, schej.it) got popular for planning large group events. I was inspired to use this after having trouble finding people to carpool with for off campus events in university clubs. The existing websites for carpooling require too much manual coordination. My site is sign up and forget. 24 hours before the event starts, I text message every rider and driver their route details. No site of such existed so I made it.
    <li>
      <span>Launched March 2024: </span><a href="https://farmware-xi.vercel.app/" target="_blank">farmware.app</a>, <a href="https://github.com/giridhar7632/farmware">code</a>: A website for farmers to visualize soil moisture on their farms using open satellite imagery. Won best startup idea for the Convex       (backend as a service) hackathon. Sentinel-2 satellite images from the European Space Agency were used through their API. The normalized moisture index (NDMI) was calculated from the satellite data. Built this with 2 other nifty teammates.
    </li>
    <li>Launched Jan 2024: <a href="https://lablab.ai/event/nextgen-gpt-ai-hackathon/jarvis/ai-project-manager-assistant" target="_blank">AI Project Manager Assistant</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/ai-project-manager-assistant">code</a>: A slack bot assistant for project/product managers. Allows them to get zoom meeting summaries sent to them over slack. The bot has the ability to store past meeting transcriptions + summaries using Supabase (hosted Postgres). Can
write a slack command to list the meeting summaries of today. Team of 2.</li>
    <li><span>June 2023: </span><a href="https://dtogether.ca" target="_blank">dtogether.ca (deactivated because I abandoned it)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/dtogether.ca-backend">code</a>: A secondhand marketplace for diabetics, especially type 1 like myself, to sell excess supplies. This could include insulin pump or glucose sensor supplies. Frontend deployed on Vercel, backend on Railway. Built using a open source marketplace platform called Medusa. Inspired after becoming type 1 diabetic myself and seeing others sell hundreds of dollars worth of supplies at 50-70% discounts inside an active <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1087611668259945/" target="_blank">facebook group</a>, instead using of a proper marketplace. $500 worth of supplies would be $100. A verification system would be nice to prevent people from flipping supplies in order to make money. I made a very basic, non-functional version of a marketplace before I called quits because of how much work it would be to make it work and convince everyone to switch from facebook. But it was all a nice intro though to using an open source framework like Medusa and learning from others in the Medusa discord server.
