    I'm Sabih (suh-bee). I have many ideas inspired from my daily observations. What excites me is building useful software that creates impact. I also enjoy programming and learning about the latest tools, including LLMs. If you want to learn more about me, check out my <a target="_blank" href="https://dub.sh/about-me">5 minute article.</a>

  <h2>What I'm up to now</h2>
    <div align="left">
      <p>Last updated June 11, 2025:</p>
      <p>Been looking for my next thing to join since mid-apr. Whether that's a swe role or my own startup. Doing mass outreach on linkedin rn, trying to validate a few startup ideas I have. Not in a rush for anything, although I wish things were a bit more intense like it was at my last startup, Keepsake.</p>

  <h2 style="font-weight: bold">4 notable projects I made for fun/learning:</h2>
  <ul align="left">
    <li><span>Launched July 2025: </span><a href="https://bolt-sabih.netlify.app/" target="_blank">cityflow.com</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/cityflow">code</a>: An asset management site for cities. It can be used to handle the end to end flow all the way from resident complaint submission, to office staff triaging complaints, to field teams seeing the complaint, marking it as resolved, and notyfing the resident through email. It also allows inventory management, so the field teams always have repair items in stock. I was inspired by this after talking to the public works director of Evans, CO, a small city with 20k people. He mentioned the software they bought, Brightly, brightlysoftware.com, was all they could afford,, and it was lacking. In fact, The first thing he said about it was "this is a sore point". So I made one with my friend during a hackathon. The frontend is ugly as it was made with bolt.new, which sped up development. I still had to write and fix a lot of code manually.
    </li>
    <li><span>Launched July 2024: </span><a href="https://antride.ca" target="_blank">antride.ca</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/ant-ride">code</a>: The easiest way to organize carpools for one-off events, with automated, with optimized routes created for everyone.  Just like how schej.it got popular for planning large group events. I was inspired to use this after having trouble finding people to carpool with, for off-campus events in uni clubs. The existing websites for carpooling require too much manual work, such as choosing who to ride with, creating unoptimal routes. My site is sign up once and forget. 24 hours before the event starts, I text message every rider and driver their route details. No site of such existed so I made it. caroster.com and groupcarpool.com both did not support automated route creation.
    <li>
      <span>Launched March 2024: </span><a href="https://farmware-xi.vercel.app/" target="_blank">farmware.app</a>, <a href="https://github.com/giridhar7632/farmware">code</a>: A website for farmers to visualize soil moisture on their farms using open satellite imagery. Won best startup idea for the Convex       (backend as a service) hackathon. Sentinel-2 satellite images from the European Space Agency were used through their API. The normalized moisture index (NDMI) was calculated from the satellite data. Built this with 2 other great teammates.
    </li>
    <li>Launched Jan 2024: <a href="https://lablab.ai/event/nextgen-gpt-ai-hackathon/jarvis/ai-project-manager-assistant" target="_blank">AI Project Manager Assistant</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/ai-project-manager-assistant">code</a>: A slack bot assistant for people with a lot of meetings. It allows you to get your day's meeting summaries sent to you over slack., wath a simple command. The bot has the ability to store past meeting transcriptions + summaries using supabase (hosted postgres). Made this with a teammate during a hackathon, won 2nd place.</li>
